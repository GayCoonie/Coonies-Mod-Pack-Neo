# Coonie's Balatro Modpack Neo

## Now Rebooted for Newcalc Compat. Hope to eventually bring everyting over, but for now I'll work wwith what I can get

### A curated collection of Balatro mods made by many wonderful members of the community. Collected by GayCoonie. 

### !!Warning: Don't download via the code button, that will not work as this repository includes submodules. Use the provided release!!

These are basically just the mods I personally play with. Sharing because it's a relatively large amount that I know all work together, and also because it's curated towards a vannilia+ game experience where things can get nuts, but only if you want them to. It's mostly just more of the same from the base game, and a lot of interesting spins on it without straying too much from Balatro as we know it. All told once I finish putting this together there will be over 700 jookers, over 100 vouchers, and a couple choice additions to spectrals, planets, and tarots. I don't take credit for any of this of course. I just found all these mods and think they ought to be in one place. This is largely inspired by [Dimserene](https://github.com/Dimserene//)'s mod pack, but with mine having a somewhat different aim. 

Some of the mods included in this pack have modifications, which are listed below. This is to keep them matching what I personally am playing with, as is kinda the silly gimmick of this modpack. Additionally, fair warning that not everything here is 100% stable, and I often run into crashes eventually in a run. Saing as this is what I personally play with, I'm always removing, adding, and updating mods to try to keep an enjoyable and stable experience. And from now on I will be updating this mod pack to reflect whatever changes I make to my own local setup.
